      "Above all, the aim is consistency each time the phantom is setup and measured. These\n",
      "instructions mainly attempt to keep everything the same every time: phantom orientation and\n",
      "position, coil setup, heart rate, factors affecting scanner calibrations such as the “shim”\n",
      "volume, shim methods, etc. Please try to keep this basic aim in mind. Although running the\n",
      "B “shim” is arguably undesirable please note this is specified and should be operated in the\n",
      "0\n",
      "same mode with the same receiver coils for it, and the same calculation or fitting volume\n",
      "used each time.\n",
      "The arrangement of tubes in the phantom is not random: it avoids placing long-T1 tubes in\n",
      "the corner positions where B and B distortions associated with the phantom are greatest.\n",
      "0 1\n",
      "Alignment of tubes with the B direction and scanning halfway along them, not towards their\n",
      "0\n",
      "ends, are also important factors in avoiding measurements in regions using distorted fields.\n",
      "Please do not add “loading” phantoms – the phantom has been tested without these on all\n",
      "systems.\n",
      "The suggested R-R interval 900ms (heart-rate 67bpm) requires explanation. For good\n",
      "reasons known in the literature, some T1-mapping methods on some scanners run for a\n",
      "fixed period of seconds, fitting in however many images they can, at one per cardiac-cycle in\n",
      "the prescribed time. However, a phantom scan using a simulator resulting in an exact \"fit\" of\n",
      "cycles into the prescribed delay, could result in a variable number of images caused by\n",
      "small simulator timing differences on repeated scans. The R-R at 900ms is an attempt to\n",
      "avoid this problem in the most common case (Siemens 5s[3s]3s and 4s[1s]3s[1s]2s).\n",
      "Depending on your T1-mapping sequence, an R-R of 800ms or 1000ms may still run\n",
      "repeatably reliably. Provided that the SAME R-R value is used for each session this would\n",

      "1 | PHANTOM OVERVIEW\n",
      "1. The phantom consists of an amber plastic bottle sealed by a tight black cap.\n",
      " NEVER OPEN THE CAP\n",
      "2. Inside the bottle is an agar/nickel chloride (NiCl )/high-density plastic bead fill containing\n",
      "2\n",
      "a 3 X 3 array of plastic tubes filled with the T1/T2 mixtures. The tubes rest on a resin\n",
      "layer at the base (Figure 1).\n",
      "3. There is a label with a red isocenter cross on the front surface of the bottle to aid\n",
      "positioning in the scanner.\n",
      "4. There is another label on the back of the bottle that contains the unique 6-digit phantom\n",
      "identity number (ID) - e.g. 15E001 or 30E008. The first 2 numbers (‘15’ | ‘30’) indicate\n",
      "whether this is a 1.5T or 3T phantom. ‘E’ indicates the model, and the last three digits\n",
      "are the unique serial number.\n",
      "5. Please use the Phantom ID for all data entry.\n",
      "6. Along the top of the bottle’s front surface, is a liquid crystal display (LCD) thermometer\n",
      "strip.\n",
      "Figure 1. External features of the phantom.\n",
      "PC018.F06 Rev. 27 October 2015 4\n",
      "T1MES Phantom\n",
      "2 | PHANTOM CARE\n",
      "1. On receiving the phantom, unpack and inspect it. Take photos if it appears damaged and\n",
      "upload these onto REDCap (see 6.1). Use REDCap to log a description of the fault.\n",
      "2. Please be gentle when moving the phantom around - do not drop or shake it.\n",
      "3. Do not place heavy objects on top of or strongly against the phantom at any time (the\n",
      "phantom outer bottle is quite flexible).\n",
      "4. In between research scans, store the phantom upright in your scanner room for\n",
      "temperature consistency with scanning, and in the same protected area each time.\n",
      " STORE THE PHANTOM VERTICALLY UPRIGHT\n",
      "3 | INSTRUCTIONS FOR PHANTOM SETUP\n",
      "3.1 | TEMPERATURE\n",
      "1. There is a self-adhesive LCD temperature strip with temperature range 10°C to 40°C\n",
      "along the upper surface of the phantom (Figure 2). Temperature markers appear at an\n",
      "interval of 2°C, but the resolution of the strip is actually 1°C.\n",
      "2. Take note of phantom temperature before starting each new scan.\n",
      "3. If there is a bright GREEN cell, this marks the exact phantom temperature (it will be an\n",
      "even number).\n",
      "4. If there is no green cell but adjacent BLUE and TAN cells, then exact phantom\n",
      "temperature is the odd number in between (Figure 3).\n",
      "5. Phantom temperature must be added to the <Patient Name> when registering the new\n",
      "scan on your MRI scanner (see 4.1).\n",

      "AIM TO POSITION THE PHANTOM AT ISOCENTER USING THE SAME\n",
      "SUPPORTING MATERIALS IN EACH SCANNING SESSION\n",
      "(+/-1cm across [x] and along [z] the bed; +/-3cm for height [y])\n",
      "1. Set up and scan the phantom at the isocenter position and in exactly the same way each\n",
      "time for repeat scans.\n",
      "2. If you notice something unspecified while handling/scanning the phantom, please\n",
      "feedback on what it was.\n",
      "3. Read your manufacturer-specific instruction in the Appendix for where along the table to\n",
      "place the phantom, i.e. in the z direction (for Siemens see A8.1.1; for Philips see A8.2.1;\n",
      "for GE see A8.3.1).\n",
      "4. Do not place the phantom directly onto the spine or bed coil. To bring it up to isocenter\n",
      "you must elevate the phantom bottle above the spine or bed coil by using a firm support.\n",
      "5. This height depends on your scanner model and MRI table options. (For Siemens see\n",
      "A8.1.1; for Philips see A8.2.1; for GE see A8.3.1). Test the height of the firm support to\n",
      "find one that will lift your phantom to isocenter (see Figure 4).\n",
      "USE THIS SAME FIRM SUPPORT FOR ALL SUBSEQUENT SCANS.\n",
      "6. The firm support must be FIRM. It cannot be so soft that it will deform erratically and\n",
      "prevent consistent phantom positioning (i.e. avoid ordinary pillows and blankets for this\n",
      "application).\n",
      "7. Suggested materials to use as firm support include:\n",
      "a. A stack of glued (not stapled) spine journals.\n",
      "b. A firm supporting (foam plastic) slab that may come with your scanner equipment.\n",
      "8. Once you configure the correct firm support STORE it in the scanner room with the\n",
      "phantom.\n",
      "9. Lay the T1MES phantom onto the firm support as in Figure 4.\n",
      " STORE AND ALWAYS USE THE SAME FIRM SUPPORT FOR EACH SCAN\n",
      "Figure 4. Phantom setup on the table (the ‘M’ of T1MES in the figure below is at isocenter).\n",

      "PC018.F06 Rev. 27 October 2015 6\n",

      "between the correct table markers for where you would usually position the patient’s\n",
      "heart.\n",
      "12. The black bottle cap (equivalent to the ‘Head’) for the specified head-first registration of\n",
      "patient orientation must point into the bore. The isocenter cross sticker must be on the\n",
      "upper surface of the bottle.\n",
      "13. Before doing anything else, move the table and shine the laser target markers onto the\n",
      "phantom arrangement till the laser markers are aligned with the red isocenter cross. The\n",
      "pair of x-lines and the pair of z-lines should overlap.\n",
      "14. Memorize phantom temperature now and before introducing bottle into the bore.\n",
      "15. Obtain a thick blanket, folded over into a generous rectangular shape and drape this\n",
      "over the top of the phantom. Do this after having isocentered with lights, but before\n",
      "applying the surface coil.\n",
      "16. If possible, use the same anterior cardiac coil for all subsequent phantom experiments.\n",
      "17. During the subsequent steps, note that the phantom may accidentally be shifted or\n",
      "twisted, and this should be avoided.\n",
      "18. Place the anterior coil onto the blanket that is overlying the phantom with laser target\n",
      "marker still turned on. Adjust the position of the anterior coil manually (do not move the\n",
      "table nor inadvertently slide the phantom) till the isocenter cross of the coil is aligned\n",
      "with the laser target markers.\n",
      "19. Strap the anterior coil into place to prevent it slipping off the phantom arrangement.\n",
      "Tighten the straps to secure the blanket around the T1MES bottle.\n",
      "20. While unlikely to matter, please use consistent air-flow settings for repeated scans (e.g.\n",
      "set the patient fan in the scanner to medium each session).\n",
      "21. Once you configure the correct firm support, STORE it in the scanner room ready for\n",
